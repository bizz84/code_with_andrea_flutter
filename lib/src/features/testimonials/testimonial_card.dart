I can honestly say that Andrea's knowledge and guidance is top notch! He explains the principles well which helps you understand the concepts and structures within the Dart language.

This course is a great asset to anyone looking to improve their coding skills. Having Andrea by your side, you should feel privileged to have a mentor / coach of his caliber, who shares his knowledge in such an 'easy to understand' manner. Thanks!

Clear explanations, a useful practical application that demonstrates all the core things essential to building an app ready for release into the wild.

Every step taken is clearly and thoroughly explained, plus downloadable code for every section of this course. A fantastic current course and is proving invaluable for strategies for building ideas for my own app.

Cannot praise this course and Andreaâ€™s presentation highly enough.

Andrea is an excellent instructor and developer. Very thankful he takes the time to create these courses and maintain his YouTube tutorials.

The way Andrea codes reveals a lot of best practices, good app architecture, and interesting techniques; his source code is very clean and logical.

In my opinion, this gives him a unique advantage versus other online instructors who write code to illustrate a point but often shortcuts are taken or it is not production quality.

There are more intermediate level tips I don't see other devs covering. Thanks so much Andrea!!

This is by far the best flutter course if you want to learn coding best practises while learning flutter, which I think everyone should.

I've taken two other top rated flutter courses in Udemy and speaking by experience.

Another impressive thing about this course is that most of the videos are around 5 minutes even to cover complex topics. I am pretty sure Andrea has put lot of work to make them as such.
